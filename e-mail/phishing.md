e-mail phishing/scamming is one of the easiest ways for a hacker to gain access to your accounts and without a little knowledge it’s hard to spot.

When receiving an email check the actual email address by clicking on Show more Details at the top or clicking on the senders name. For example you may recieve an email from “Apple Help”

But under futher inspection the email address is applehelp@fakecompany.com.

The same goes for **Links or URL’s in emails** you can make a link look like something else, be sure to hover over the url\(DO NOT CLICK\) and see the real address at the bottom left of your screen.

If this is slightly overwhelming for you, dont worry but follow this one rule:

**Don’t click anything in e-mails unless you are expecting it.** If you recieve an email saying you have ordered something you have not, or your Government account is broken. Don’t click the link, instead go to the website in question \(ie Amazon.com or SSA.gov and review the issue from there.
