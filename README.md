# Security Online Guide {#securityonlineguide}

# **Guidebook**

_**This guide is a work in progress**_

This guide will hopefully help you understand internet security and feel safe and secure when browsing the internet. The focus will mainly be on home computers directed at the less technical user but is useful for all.

Please consider that this guide is for a general overview and understanding on basic computer security - it will not be perfect nor cover all topics \(aimed at the casual internet user\), feel free to critique or request additions though!

**If you believe you're computer is compromised - Contact someone with IT knowledge, don't do anything you're unsure about.**
