### Setting up 2-Factor Authentication

Choose an App you wish to use for 2fa, the three recommended here are: **Google Authenticator, Authy, FreeOTP**

Once the app is downloaded you may need to setup an account with Authy or Google Authenticator or use an existing account.

Now you're app is running follow the instructions and you should be ready to start setting up accounts to have 2 Factor Authentication.

Visit each website you want to have 2-Factor Authentication \(_We recommend all accounts but at a minimum accounts with valuable personal information, bank accounts, payment systems, important work, **E-Mail**\)._

1. 2Factor Authentication is found generally in the Security Section of your settings for accounts.
2. Once you have found it you'll be given a QR code like below.
3. Either Scan the QR code or entry a string of text into your app.
4. You'll now be given a code to type back into the website to confirm it is paired.
5. Once that is complete you'll usually be given a list of recovery codes \(this is incase you lose your phone and can't log on\)
6. Print out the list and keep it somewhere safe, these are one time use codes allowing you entry without your 2 factor authenticator.
