Malware removal is sometimes a difficult task, however there are reputable programs used to remove or prevent Malware.

Malwarebytes is the industry leader for removal found here

The free version has no active protection but does a successful job at removing malware already on your system

I recommend looking at this internet thread for a more detailed guide of difficult to remove Malware!

The solution with the best results is to **reinstall your operating system** \(Windows/Mac/Linux\) from scratch \(Do remember to backup your important documents/photos/files**!**\). This can be done with a CD/USB with the Operating System on and reinstalling with that.

System Restore is** not** a suitable solution to stop malware \(and sometimes makes the problem worse\)

_Please note: an AntiVirus or similar software will not always with 100% accuracy find malware. Do not rely on them to stay safe, use your common sense and knowledge to avoid a bad situation!_

**Again if in doubt contact someone you know for advice!**
