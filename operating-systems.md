# **Operating Systems**

Whether you use Windows/Mac/Linux for your computer or Android/iOS for your smart phone updating is vital. From my experience most people hate getting updates however majority of the time they are there for your safety! New ways to break into computers are found all the time and your system needs an update to fix it. Consider checking for updating atleast once a week!

### None Admin\(Super User\) Account

When using a computer for daily use you do not require Administrative powers, Browsing the web, checking emails can be done on a standard user account. By logging onto your standard account it makes it harder for viruses to get into your computer as Adminsitrators have more control over the computer \(installing software etc\).
