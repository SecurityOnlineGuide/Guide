# Types of Viruses/Malware

This is just a short section to describe some of the types of viruses to help you understand what they do. Anything you can do on your computer a virus can gain access to, do not underestimate them.

#### Virus

Viruses like their biological counterpart replicate and spread themselves \(usually to other computers\) but can also be used a general term for malicious software.

#### Rootkit

Rootkits are code which allow access to low level parts of your computer such as adminstrative access or the root when generally access is not allowed.

#### Ransomware

Is a relatively new type of malware which locks all the computers files with a secret password not allowing the owner of the device to gain access to it until they have paid money. **ANOTHER REASON TO BACK UP YOUR VALUABLE FILES EXTERNALLY**

#### Spyware

Spyware is simply something that is sending information back somewhere. It could be logging your keystrokes \(like a keylogger\) telling the hacker your passwords or bank details, or what websites you visit.

#### Adware

Infects the computer to display advertisements where there usually arent, or specific advertisements.

#### Scareware

Is software or scripts that scare the user into downloading/buying something alot worse than they originally had. As the general tips said, Don't panic if something like this happens. Seek advice from someone personally.

#### Keylogger

Similar to its name, a Key logger logs your keystrokes knowing what you have typed, which can include emails, messages, credit card details, passwords and usernames.

#### Trojan Horse

Like it's historical counterpart this is a piece of software which has tricked a user into giving it access.

You may have also heard of the term **Botnet **or** Zombie Computer**, these terms refer to the fact that when a computer is infected a hacker can take large groups of infected computers and use them for a larger goal.
