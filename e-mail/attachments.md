### Attachments

Similar rules apply, attachments especially Office documents can be malicious. Do not open unless you are expecting it. If your friend sends you a “CuteCatPictures.ppt” out of the blue with no previous knowledge or the email text has no personality or indentifiable communication to it their account may have been hacked and it’s trying to infect you too.
