# **Addons/Extensions and Plugins for Browsers**

Addons \(also known as Extensions\) are used to improve the experience within the browser.However addons are like any other download and can be used maliciously. Use caution when installing addons \(check reviews, see if it is legitimate, or if you really need it\). You obtain them through each official browsers "Store" in [Chrome](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/test.md), [Firefox](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/firefox.md), [Edge](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/edge.md)

Recommended Addons:

* **uBlock Origin** - _created by Raymond Hill \(Gorhill\)_ is a lightweight blocker - removing advertisements\* \(which we discussed earlier can be an entrance point for malware\), tracking lists and more.

###### _ _

* **HTTPS Everywhere** - _created by EFF_ is an addon which when you visit a website asks to use the "Secure" version instead \(discussed earlier in Browsers\).

If you must use **plugins such as Flash and Java **- they are known to have security issues** ,**but in most cases the plugins are obsolete now - remove them or change the setting to Ask before Activation in the plugins part of settings, **KEEP THEM UP TO DATE**. 

###### _\*Whilst removing ads does decrease revenue for a website \(which do cost money to run\) you are able to disable your adblock on websites you TRUST and want to support. This can be done by clicking the ublock Origin Icon\( Red Shield with UD\) in your toolbar then the Power button so it turns grey_
