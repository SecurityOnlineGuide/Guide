# Types of Viruses/Malware

This is just a short section to describe some of the types of viruses to help you understand what they do.

#### Virus

Viruses like their biological counterpart replicate and spread themselves \(usually to other computers\) but can also be used a general term for malicious software.

#### Rootkit

#### Worm

#### Ransomware

Is a relatively new type of malware which locks all the computers files with a secret password not allowing the owner of the device to gain access to it until they have paid money. **ANOTHER REASON TO BACK UP YOUR VALUABLE FILES EXTERNALLY**

#### Spyware

Spyware is simply something that is sending information back somewhere. It could be logging your keystrokes \(like a keylogger\) telling the hacker your passwords or bank details, or what websites you visit.

#### Adware

Infects the computer to display advertisements where there usually arent, or specific advertisements.

#### Scareware

#### Keylogger

#### Trojan Horse

Like it's historical counterpart this is a piece of software which has tricked a user into giving it access.
