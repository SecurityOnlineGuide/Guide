# **Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\)**

2Factor Authentication is just as if not **MORE important** as having a secure password. As the name suggests it means when logging onto a service you have to provide a second method of authentication. This can be simply a text message with a code, an APP or a piece of hardware.

Think of 2Factor Authentication as a Second Password which only works for a short period of time.

If a hacker gains access to your first password, there is very little they can do to get onto the account without the Second Password \(2fa\) which is only sent to you.

The most secure method is a hardware 2fa device however an app is very secure, avoid text based authentication unless there are no other options as it is the least secure.
