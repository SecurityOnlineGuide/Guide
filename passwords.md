# **Password**

Passwords are used to keep your account private. Rather than going into detail on the probability of password break ins \(I do advise you to look into the subject further though\), i'll try and simplify the strength by stating three things.

1. Password Length: A password security increases exponentially with each added character. I recommend using atleast 15+ characters in passwords and the higher the better!
2. Password Symbols/Numbers/LowerCase/UpperCase: Using a variety of Symbols, Numbers and different cases makes bruteforcing more difficult.
3. Complicating Words in Passwords: If youre using words or sentences - try and substitute letters or remove. This will make a dictionary bruteforce attempt harder.

Lets look into a couple of different passwords:

\(In this example we're taking a song lyric - I bless the rains - easy to remember\)

1. iblesstherains - 14 Characters, All Dictionary Words,
2. IBlessTheRains - 14 Characters, All Dictionary Words, Mix of Lower&Upper Case
3. I,Bless.The.Rains? - 18 Characters, 4 Symbols, Mix of Lower & Upper Case
4. I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns? - 18 Characters, 4 Symbols , Mix of Lower &Upper Case, 4 Symbols ,4 Numbers

Obviously 4 is the most secure but it is more difficult to remember initially - Don't panic below we have solutions on keeping passwords.

There are many different ways your account/password can be taken however we’ll cover the main ones:

1. BruteForce: This is when a person or program will go through millions of combinations of passwords to break in.

2. Online Hack: If you have gotten malware your computer is compromised and information on your computer can be sent to the hacker.

3. Data Breach \(See Yahoo Hacks / Cloudbleed\): Sadly companies aren’t perfect and their services either have bugs or get hacked releasing personal information, sometimes including passwords.

---

However people fail to realise that using the same password for different websites/accounts is a very insecure choice. Take thsi example below:

You have an account on Stroodlemail.com, the service or you accidentally expose your account details \(these things do happen - see the recent yahoo hacks - link here\). Your email address and password are now out for anyone to see, people will now try using this information on different services - if you use the same password elsewhere - they are now in your other accounts.

You have multiple options with different passwords:

1. Having one major secure password and adding an unique code at the end of each different service. for example:Major Password: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns? Password when using Stroodlemail: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**STR** \(Adding STR for **STROODLEMAIL**\)Password when using Seddit: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**SED** \(Adding SED for **SED**DIT\)**Pros:** This means you only need to remember one password and the formula for additional services. **Cons:** A directed attack on you means an individual could figure out your system.
2. Using a password manager. This is a piece of software or addon for browsers which save the passwords you use. Think of it as a Vault or Safe, You're storing all your passwords in there for the computer to remember. **Pros:** Allows you to use very very complicated long passwords, which means more security. You also never need to remember passwords again \(except the master password to enter\)**Cons:** There is a small learning curve to understand the software.
3. The Old Fashioned way. Have unique different passwords for each service and write them down and keep them safe.

**Pros:** Allows for secure passwords. No memorisation needed

**Cons:** Someone physically near you could steal your passwords.

Now all 3 systems have their pros and cons, choose which suits you best but make sure you are using different passwords for different services!
