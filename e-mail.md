# **E-Mail**

Firstly getting into someoneâ€™s e-mail is the **Holy Grail** for a hacker \(Get two factor authentication as soon as possible! See [\#2fa](/two-factor-authentication-2fa.md)\). Account passwords \(Think Amazon/Paypal/Bank\) can be reset to your email address so once they have access to your e-mail they can gain access to **everything**. We recommend having a couple of different email accounts. For example:

1. For none payment services \(Newsletters,free software\)
2. For Payment services \(paypal/amazon/bank\)
3. For Personal \(e-mailing family and friends\)

Not only does this make phishing emails easier to figure out \(Money Scam on your Personal one\) but this also reduces your risk if one account gets breached, it also keeps everything more organised!
