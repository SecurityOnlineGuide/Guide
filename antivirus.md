# **AntiVirus**

Antiviruses are software suites which keep a constant eye on your computer and try and prevent and assist you if malware is found.

Windows Defender _\(The built in antivirus for Windows 7+\)_ has come along way in the past years and for general usage should be enough, Have realtime protection enabled, with SmartScreen enabled. If you're looking for a hardened experience you can consider buying Malwarebytes Premium or Kaspersky Lab/BitDefender \(Feel free to look into reviews yourself, but this was our findings as of May 2017\)

For Mac

Macs/OSX are built differently and a smaller market meaning there is less malware created for them, this does not mean that you are perfectly safe! With smart browsing habits an active antivirus is not needed. However if you feel you need a hardened experience check out AVG antivirus and BitDefender, these two were the highest rated/sucessful antivirus  for Mac/OSX as of May 2017.

# **How to remove**

Malware removal is sometimes a difficult task, however there are reputable programs used to remove or prevent Malware.

Malwarebytes is the industry leader for removal found here [https://www.malwarebytes.com/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) \(Windows\) and [https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/) \(Mac\) - The Free version has no active protection but does a successful job at removing malware already on your system

I recommend looking at this internet thread for a more detailed guide of difficult to remove Malware!

The solution with the best results is to reinstall your operating system \(Windows/Mac/Linux\) from scratch \(**Do remember to backup your important documents/photos/files!**\). This can be done with a CD/USB with the Operating System on and reinstalling with that.

System Restore is not a suitable solution to stop malware \(and sometimes makes the problem worse\)

_Please note: an AntiVirus or similar software will not always with 100% accuracy find malware. Do not rely on them to stay safe, use your common sense and knowledge to avoid a bad situation!_
