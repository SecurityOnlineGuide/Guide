# **Operating Systems**

Whether you use Windows/Mac/Linux for your computer or Android/iOS for your smart phone updating is vital. From my experience most people hate getting updates however majority of the time they are there for your safety! New ways to break into computers are found all the time and your system needs an update to fix it. Consider checking for updating atleast once a week!

**Windows:**

Hitting the windows key and search for Update should show "Check for Updates" in Windows 10, and "Windows Updates" in 7/8

Windows XP and Vista is no longer supported \(meaning new ways to break into computers will not be fixed\) if you have a PC with XP or Vista we recommend upgrading to Windows 7 or further.

Windows 7 will stop being supported in **2020.**

**Mac**

Visit the App Store and click the Updates tab and update all. If you do not see this use the Software Update in the apple menu.

**Linux**

As this is a beginners guide to security, I won't discuss terminal commands and more difficult distributions however with Ubuntu based distrubutions search Software Updater and follow the instructions.

### None Admin\(Super User\) Account

When using a computer for daily use you do not require Administrative powers, Browsing the web, checking emails can be done on a standard user account. By logging onto your standard account it makes it harder for viruses to get into your computer as Adminsitrators have more control over the computer \(installing software etc\).

On Mac: 

On Windows : User Accounts

On Linux:
