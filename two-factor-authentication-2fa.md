**Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\)**

2Factor Authentication is just as if not **MORE important** as having a secure password. As the name suggests it means when logging onto a service you have to provide a second method of authentication. This can be simply a text message with a code, an APP or a piece of hardware.

Think of 2Factor Authentication as a Second Password which only works for a short period of time.

Now before you think this is complicated you've probably already used it before with your bank with a devise like this

If a hacker gains access to your first password, there is very little they can do to get onto the account without the Second Password \(2fa\) which is only sent to you via text/app/device.

A great way to check if your account has 2FA or you need help setting it up is visiting [https://twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org) which has a large list of different websites/services easily organised for you!

_The most secure method is a hardware 2fa device however an app is very secure, avoid text based authentication unless there are no other options as it is the least secure but still alot **better than not having one**!_
