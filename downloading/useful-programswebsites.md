From their website: "Scores are assigned based on factors such as a website's age, historical locations, changes, and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis. We've advanced how we apply web reputation to keep pace with new types of criminal attacks that can come and go very quickly, or try to stay hidden."

### Bloatware/Unwanted Software

**Unchecky** - [https://unchecky.com/](https://unchecky.com/) _\(Install and forget about it\)_

If you're someone who finds themselves with lots of extra software and toolbars we recommend **Unchecky.**. When installing new software there are usually custom options to download other products which most users don't see. This little program will make sure you only install the items you want.

### Terms and Conditions

**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**- [https://tosdr.org/index.html](https://tosdr.org/index.html)_ \(Consider bookmarking, the star in the menu bar\)_

We all should read Terms and Conditions when downloading a program or use a service. However the wording and length is sometimes complicated and takes a while. This site gives you brief descriptions of terms and conditions of the product you are using. Highly recommend.
