# **Malware/Viruses**

Whether you're new to computers or the internet or have been around a while, almost everyone has heard of Viruses or Malware.

Malware is an umbrella term for the joint two words "Malicious"+"Software".

The objective of the software could be as simple as showing you an advertisement to the more extreme like tracking your activity, stealing your bank details or recording you.

### **How to avoid**

The most common ways viruses/malware are obtained are

1. Downloading\(see [\#downloading](/downloading.md)\)

2. e-Mail attachments\(see [\#email](/e-mail.md)\)

3. Software/Operating System not up to Date\(see [\#Operating System](/operating-systems.md)\)

4. Malicious Websites â€“ \(see [\#domain](/domains.md)\)

### **How to remove**

Malware removal is sometimes a difficult task, however there are reputable programs used to remove or prevent Malware.

Malwarebytes is the industry leader for removal found here [https://www.malwarebytes.com/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - The Free version has no active protection but does a successful job at removing malware already on your system

I recommend looking at this internet thread for a more detailed guide of difficult to remove Malware!

Please note an AntiVirus or similar software will not always with 100% accuracy find malware. Do not rely on them to stay safe, use your common sense and knowledge to avoid a bad situation!

The solution with the best results is to reinstall your operating system \(Windows/Mac/Linux\) from scratch \(**Do remember to backup your important documents/photos/files!**\). This can be done with a CD/USB with the Operating System on and reinstalling with that.

System Restore is not a suitable solution to stop malware \(and sometimes makes the problem worse\)
