# FreeOTP

[FreeOTP.github.io   ](https://freeotp.github.io/)                                                                        [   ](/antivirus.md)                                                                   

An OpenSource alternative to Google Authenticator, very simple app with few features.

_Recommended if you want an open source app that does not need features or want to sync across multiple devices and want something straight forward._
