# **Windows Operating System**

## Updating

Hitting the windows key and search for Update should show "Check for Updates" in Windows 10, and "Windows Updates" in 7/8

Windows XP and Vista is no longer supported \(meaning new ways to break into computers will not be fixed\) if you have a PC with XP or Vista we recommend upgrading to Windows 7 or further.

Windows 7 will stop being supported in **2020.**

**Check for updates atleast once a week!**
