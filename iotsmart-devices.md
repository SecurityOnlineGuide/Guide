# Smart Devices

First we'll quickly define what is a smart device and IoT.

Smart devices are electronics which connect to other devices/networks, usually without cables, to perform activities without input required for a user. IE, your phone, a "smart lightbulb", printers etc.

IoT means Internet of Things which simplicistically put is networking of devices/objects over the internet. ie Smart Thermostat

As convienent, cool and futuristic some of this stuff is sadly not all of them are configured safely, leaving open doors for hackers to get into your network!

As we can't go into detail for every individual device here are some tips to help keep you more secure:

* Changing from the default password
* Updating\(their firmware\) atleast once a month.
* Having less reliance on cloud technologies
