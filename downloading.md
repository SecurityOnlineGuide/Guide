# **Downloading and Installing - WIP**

**Section on Executables**

**Reputable sources only**

If you're someone who finds themselves with lots of extra software and toolbars we recommend **Unchecky** - [https://unchecky.com/](https://unchecky.com/) - When installing new software there are usually custom options to download other products which most users don't see. This little program will make sure you only install the items you want.

**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**- [https://tosdr.org/index.html](https://tosdr.org/index.html) - We all should read Terms and Conditions when downloading a program or use a service. However the wording and length is sometimes complicated and takes a while. This site gives you brief descriptions of terms and conditions of the product you are using. Highly recommend.
