# Surfing the Web and Downloading

### **Section on Executables**

Downloading things off the internet and running them without care or caution is a sure fire way to get yourself infected. Make sure you need what you are downloading, have checked it's from the official source, and the Open File - Security Warning displays the correct publisher. Look at the example below:![](/assets/downloading.png)

Firstly in the top right, downloads are usually symbolised by the down arrow. On Windows if you've lost the download they will be located in your computer in a folder called Downloads on the left hand side. When downloading this we also checked the URL \(the long address bar at the top, to see if its the official site and if it is a Secure site the green padlock\). Finally with the Open File warning the publisher of the file is listed correctly so we know it is official.

### Useful Programs/Websites

If you're someone who finds themselves with lots of extra software and toolbars we recommend **Unchecky** - [https://unchecky.com/](https://unchecky.com/) - When installing new software there are usually custom options to download other products which most users don't see. This little program will make sure you only install the items you want.

**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**- [https://tosdr.org/index.html](https://tosdr.org/index.html) - We all should read Terms and Conditions when downloading a program or use a service. However the wording and length is sometimes complicated and takes a while. This site gives you brief descriptions of terms and conditions of the product you are using. Highly recommend.
