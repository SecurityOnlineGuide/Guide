# Virtual Private Network

You may connect to a VPN for your Business/Company without knowing it. VPN's are used to encrypt all network data, making it very difficult for someone to monitor your traffic from the WiFi level or even ISP.

This is a great tool when using Open Wifi networks as it allows you to complete sensitive tasks like doing your bank or buying something without worrying about your traffic being snooped.

It also assigns you for the outside world a different IP address which means a targeted attack on you is much more difficult.

Free VPN's are generally a very bad idea as you are the product meaning your details/passwords/bank could be stolen. We advice against any free VPN services.

Please note: Not everyone needs a VPN this is an additional step for your security, which is very useful when travelling around.

Research into different paid VPNs; Figure out what youre looking for. Some are no log policies and others aren't. Depending on your price range and purpose find a VPN Provider which suits you. Always check reviews!
