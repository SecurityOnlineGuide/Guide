# **AntiVirus**

Antiviruses are software suites which keep a constant eye on your computer and try and prevent and assist you if malware is found.

Windows Defender has come along way in the past years and for general usage should be enough, Have realtime protection enabled, with SmartScreen enabled. If you're looking for a hardened experience you can consider buying Malwarebytes Premium or Kaspersky Lab/BitDefender \(Feel free to look into reviews yourself, but this was our findings as of May 2017\)

For Mac

Macs/OSX are built differently and a smaller market meaning there is less malware created for them, this does not mean that you are perfectly safe! With smart browsing habits an active antivirus is not needed. However if you feel you need a hardened experience check out AVG antivirus and BitDefender, these two were the highest rated/sucessful antivirus  for Mac/OSX as of May 2017.
