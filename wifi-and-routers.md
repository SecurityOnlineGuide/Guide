# **Wifi & Routers**

* Public Wifi - When on a public Wifi \(Cafes/Stations/Airports etc\) you are susceptible to having your activity on the internet maliciously tracked. It is highly recommended not to log into important accounts when on one of these Wifis. Use your phones 3G/4G for important browsing when away from work or home.

* Device Settings - Passwords on Routers/Smart Devices/IoT devices **must be changed from the default** when obtained - feel free to write the new password down but do not use the default one**. Do not take this lightly.** Remote access to your devices can easily done if using the default password.

* Routers - A router is the box connecting you to the internet. There are a couple of main settings you need to confirm are in the right state:

* In your router settings \(Generally the URL 192.168.2.1\) Turn off Universal Plug and Play \(uPNP\) - this mode has many security issues and can allow external hackers access , You will know if you need it but 99% of people DO NOT.

* Update your firmware for your router atleast once a month \(Done by visiting the router interface \(Generally the URL 192.168.2.1\)\)

* Change your passwords from the default options. Both the WiFi password and the Admin Config password should be reconfigured **ASAP.** To do this visit your Routers internal website \(Generally the URL 192.168.2.1\) log in with the information given generally found on the back of your router. If the settings are not visible look for a "advanced" section. _ Make sure you are using WPA2 as your Security Protocol \(all devices bought after 2006 should have it set by default\)_
