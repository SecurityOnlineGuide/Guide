# **Addons/Extensions and Plugins for Browsers**

Addons \(also known as Extensions\) are used to improve the experience within the browser.However addons are like any other download and can be used maliciously. Use caution when installing addons \(check reviews, see if it is legitimate, or if you really need it\). You obtain them through each official browsers "Store" in [Chrome](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/test.md), [Firefox](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/firefox.md), [Edge](/addons-extensions-and-plugins/edge.md)

Recommended Addons:

* **uBlock Origin** - _created by Raymond Hill \(Gorhill\)_ is a lightweight blocker - removing advertisements\* \(which we discussed earlier can be an entrance point for malware\), tracking lists and more.

###### _\*Whilst removing ads does decrease revenue for a website \(which do cost money to run\) you are able to disable your adblock on websites you TRUST and want to support. This can be done by clicking the ublock Origin Icon\( Red Shield with UD\) in your toolbar then the Power button so it turns grey \(Image here\)._

* **HTTPS Everywhere** - _created by EFF_ is an addon which when you visit a website asks to use the "Secure" version instead \(discussed earlier in Browsers\).

If you must use plugins but in most cases they are obsolete now, **KEEP THEM UP TO DATE**. Plugins include **Java** and **Flash Player**.
