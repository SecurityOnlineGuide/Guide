# **Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\)**

2Factor Authentication is just as if not **MORE important** as having a secure password. As the name suggests it means when logging onto a service you have to provide a second method of authentication. This can be simply a text message with a code, an APP or a piece of hardware. The most secure method is a hardware dongle however an APP is the best middle ground, avoid text based authentication unless there are no other options.
