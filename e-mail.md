# **E-Mail**

Firstly getting into someone’s e-mail is the **Holy Grail** for a hacker \(Get two factor authentication as soon as possible! See \#2fa\). Accounts passwords can be reset to your email address so once they have your e-mail they can gain access to everything. I recommend having a couple of different email accounts. For example:

1. For none payment services \(Newsletters,free software\)
2. For Payment services \(paypal/amazon/bank\)
3. For Personal \(e-mailing family and friends\)

This reduces your risk if one gets breached, it also keeps everything more organised!

e-mail phishing/scamming is one of the easiest ways for a hacker to gain access to your accounts and without a little knowledge it’s hard to spot.

When receiving an email check the actual email address by clicking on Show more Details at the top or clicking on the senders name. For example you may recieve an email from “Apple Help”

But under futher inspection the email address is applehelp@fakecompany.com.

##### The same goes for Links or URL’s in emails you can make a link look like something else, be sure to hover over the url\(DONT CLICK\) and see the real address at the bottom left of your screen. Or copy and pasting the URL/Link into a notepad and seeing the true result.

If this is slightly overwhelming for you, dont worry but follow this one rule:

**Don’t click anything in e-mails unless you are expecting it.** If you recieve an email saying you have ordered something you have not, or your Government account is broken. Don’t click the link, instead go to the website in question \(ie Amazon.com or SSA.gov and review the issue from there.

### Attachments

Similar rules apply, attachments especially Office documents can be malicious. Do not open unless you are expecting it. If your friend sends you a “CuteCatPictures.ppt” out of the blue with no previous knowledge or the email text has no personality or indentifiable communication to it their account may have been hacked and it’s trying to infect you too.
