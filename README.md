# Security Online Guide {#securityonlineguide}

# **Guidebook**

_**This guide is a work in progress**_

This guide will hopefully help you understand internet security and feel safe and secure when browsing the internet. The focus will mainly be on home computers directed at the less technical user but is useful for all.

Please consider that this guide is for a general overview and understanding on basic computer security - it will not be perfect nor cover all topics \(aimed at the casual internet user\), feel free to critique or request additions though!

**If you believe you're computer is compromised - Contact someone with IT knowledge, don't do anything you're unsure about.**

# **General Tips**

1. Don't panic, take your time. If you're unsure about something, don't click/respond/interact with it until you're sure of what to do. These attempts try to take advantage of your vulnerable state to get what they want. Take a deep breath.
2. Always have a back up - or two or three... Having backups of your valued photos/documents/etc off your computer \(on a flash drive/external harddrive/cloud\) is something not to avoid, even without a virus infection - computers fail. Play it safe and back up!
3. Be careful when downloading. Know what youre downloading and make sure it's from the official website \(ie Google Chrome only from Google.com\)
4. Adblockers will save you countless times - seriously consider getting one\(see browser addons section for recommendation\)
5. Know what youre clicking/visiting/downloading - People take advantage of lack of attention to detail. Make sure your downloading from the correct website, or the correct software. **Always Double Check!**
6. If you receive an email/link to something or from someone you're unsure of. **Don't click!**
7. Only visit websites you recognise or know to be reputable.
8. Use a none Administrator\(Super User\) Account for daily use. \(Read \#OperatingSystems\)
9. Use 2 Factor Authentication and secure passwords \(Read \#Password\)
10. When downloading and installing reputable software, It is recommended to click Custom Installation and reading through each section \(Read \#Instal\)
11. You will never recieve **REAL** phone calls regarding your computer - especially from microsoft. If someone calls you to inform about a virus or something hang up.
12. Never give out your password to **ANYONE**

# **Malware/Viruses**

Whether you're new to computers or the internet or have been around a while, almost everyone has heard of Viruses or Malware.

Malware is an umbrella term for the joint two words "Malicious"+"Software".

The objective of the software could be as simple as showing you an advertisement to the more extreme like tracking your activity, stealing your bank details or recording you.

**How to avoid**

The most common ways viruses/malware are obtained are

1. Downloading\(see \#downloading\)

2. e-Mail attachments\(see \#email\)

3. Software/Operating System not up to Date\(see \#Operating System\)

4. Malicious Websites – \(see \#domain\)

# **AntiVirus**

Antiviruses are software suites which keep a constant eye on your computer and try and prevent and assist you if malware is found.

Windows Defender has come along way in the past years and for general usage should be enough, Have realtime protection enabled, with SmartScreen enabled. If you're looking for a hardened experience you can consider buying Malwarebytes Premium or Kaspersky Lab/BitDefender \(Feel free to look into reviews yourself, but this was my findings as of May 2017\)

For Mac

AVG AntIVirus or BitDefender

# **Firewall**

Firewalls are computer systems that review network activity and have rules in place to decide whether internet traffic is allowed in or out. This section is kept short because modern operating systems \(Windows/Mac/Linux\) have inbuilt firewall rules which should suffice for everyday users.

**How to remove**

Malware removal is sometimes a difficult task, however there are reputable programs used to remove or prevent Malware.

Malwarebytes is the industry leader for removal found here [https://www.malwarebytes.com/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - The Free version has no active protection but does a successful job at removing malware already on your system

I recommend looking at this internet thread for a more detailed guide of difficult to remove Malware!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested\_reading\_official\_malware\_removal\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide/)

Please note an AntiVirus or similar software will not always with 100% accuracy find malware. Do not rely on them to stay safe, use your common sense and knowledge to avoid a bad situation!

The solution with the best results is to reinstall your operating system \(Windows/Mac/Linux\) from scratch \(**Do remember to backup your important documents/photos/files!**\). This can be done with a CD/USB with the Operating System on and reinstalling with that.

System Restore is not a suitable solution to stop malware \(and sometimes makes the problem worse\)

# **Downloading and Installing**

If you're someone who finds themselves with lots of extra software and toolbars we recommend [https://unchecky.com/](https://unchecky.com/) - When installing new software there are usually custom options to download other products which most users don't see. This little program will make sure you only install the items you want.

[https://tosdr.org/index.html](https://tosdr.org/index.html) - We all should read Terms and Conditions when downloading a program or use a service. However the wording and length is sometimes complicated and takes a while. This site gives you brief descriptions of terms and conditions of the product you are using. Highly recommend.

# **Browsers**

A browser is a program used to browse the web. It is recommended you use one of the major browsers as security is the highest priority. Choose from the list below and keep the browser up to date.

Whenever you are going to log into a website, use your bank details or anything important or personal check for the Padlock or "https" in the url. This means the connection is secure**. Do not** log in or type personal information without a **Padlock!**

### Firefox \(Created by Mozilla\)

To Update Firefox you will either be prompted automatically or you can check by clicking on "Help -&gt;About" in the menu bar at the top \(if it is not visible hold the ALT button\)

![](/assets/firefox-url.jpg)

_The URL Bar & Padlock in Firefox \(Displaying HTTPS -_ _**SECURE**_** **_connection\)_



### Chrome \(Created by Google\)

To Update chrome you will either by prompted automatically or you can check by clicking the three verticle dots along the grey menu bar on the right hand side and clicking Help -&gt; About Google Chrome.

### InternetExplorer/Edge \(Created by Microsoft\)

To update Edge your Operating System will update it automatically or you can check by pressing the windows key and typing "update" and click "Check for Updates"

![](/assets/edge-url.png)

# **Addons/Extensions and Plugins for Browsers**

Addons \(also known as Extensions\) are used to improve the experience within the browser.However addons are like any other download and can be used maliciously. Use caution when installing addons \(check reviews, see if it is legitimate, or if you really need it\). You obtain them through each official browsers "Store".

Which can be found via:

![](/assets/firefox-addons.png)

_Firefox how to get extensions_

![](/assets/chrome-addons.png)

Chrome how to get Extensions

![](/assets/edge-addons.png)

_Edge how to get Extensions_

Recommended Addons:

* **uBlock Origin** - _created by Raymond Hill \(Gorhill\)_ is a lightweight blocker - removing advertisements\* \(which we discussed earlier can be an entrance point for malware\), tracking lists and more.

###### _\*Whilst removing ads does decrease revenue for a website \(which do cost money to run\) you are able to disable your adblock on websites you TRUST and want to support. This can be done by clicking the ublock Origin Icon\( Red Shield with UD\) in your toolbar then the Power button so it turns grey \(Image here\)._

* **HTTPS Everywhere** - _created by EFF_ is an addon which when you visit a website asks to use the "Secure" version instead \(discussed earlier in Browsers\).

If you must use plugins in most cases they are obsolete now, **KEEP THEM UP TO DATE**. Plugins include **Java** and **Flash Player**.

# **Operating Systems**

Whether you use Windows/Mac/Linux for your computer or Android/iOS for your smart phone updating is vital. From my experience most people hate getting updates however majority of the time they are there for your safety! New ways to break into computers are found all the time and your system needs an update to fix it. Consider checking for updating atleast once a week!

**Windows:**

Hitting the windows key and search for Update should show "Check for Updates" in Windows 10, and "Windows Updates" in 7/8

Windows XP and Vista is no longer supported \(meaning new ways to break into computers will not be fixed\) if you have a PC with XP or Vista we recommend upgrading to Windows 7 or further.

Windows 7 will stop being supported in **2020.**

**Mac**

Visit the App Store and click the Updates tab and update all. If you do not see this use the Software Update in the apple menu.

**Linux**

As this is a beginners guide to security, I won't discuss terminal commands and more difficult distributions however with Ubuntu based distrubutions search Software Updater and follow the instructions.

None Admin\(Super User\) Account

When using a computer for daily use you do not require Administrative powers, Browsing the web, checking emails can be done on a standard user account. By logging onto your standard account it makes it harder for viruses to get into your computer as Adminsitrators have more control over the computer \(installing software etc\).

On Mac

On Windows

On Linux

# **E-Mail**

Firstly getting into someone’s e-mail is the **Holy Grail** for a hacker \(Get two factor authentication as soon as possible! See \#2fa\). Accounts passwords can be reset to your email address so once they have your e-mail they can gain access to everything. I recommend having a couple of different email accounts. For example:

1. For none payment services \(Newsletters,free software\)
2. For Payment services \(paypal/amazon/bank\)
3. For Personal \(e-mailing family and friends\)

This reduces your risk if one gets breached, it also keeps everything more organised!

e-mail phishing/scamming is one of the easiest ways for a hacker to gain access to your accounts and without a little knowledge it’s hard to spot.

When receiving an email check the actual email address by clicking on Show more Details at the top or clicking on the senders name. For example you may recieve an email from “Apple Help”

But under futher inspection the email address is applehelp@fakecompany.com.

##### The same goes for Links or URL’s in emails you can make a link look like something else, be sure to hover over the url\(DONT CLICK\) and see the real address at the bottom left of your screen. Or copy and pasting the URL/Link into a notepad and seeing the true result.

#### ![](/assets/domain.png)

If this is slightly overwhelming for you, dont worry but follow this one rule:

**Don’t click anything in e-mails unless you are expecting it.** If you recieve an email saying you have ordered something you have not, or your Government account is broken. Don’t click the link, instead go to the website in question \(ie Amazon.com or SSA.gov and review the issue from there.

Attachments

Similar rules apply, attachments especially Office documents can be malicious. Do not open unless you are expecting it. If your friend sends you a “CuteCatPictures.ppt” out of the blue with no previous knowledge or the email text has no personality or indentifiable communication to it their account may have been hacked and it’s trying to infect you too.

# **Password**

Passwords are used to keep your account private. Rather than going into detail on the probability of password break ins \(I do advise you to look into the subject further though\), i'll try and simplify the strength by stating three things.

1. Password Length: A password security increases exponentially with each added character. I recommend using atleast 15+ characters in passwords and the higher the better!
2. Password Symbols/Numbers/LowerCase/UpperCase: Using a variety of Symbols, Numbers and different cases makes bruteforcing more difficult.
3. Complicating Words in Passwords: If youre using words or sentences - try and substitute letters or remove. This will make a dictionary bruteforce attempt harder. 
   ---

Lets look into a couple of different passwords:

\(In this example we're taking a song lyric - I bless the rains - easy to remember\)

1. iblesstherains - 14 Characters, All Dictionary Words,
2. IBlessTheRains - 14 Characters, All Dictionary Words, Mix of Lower&Upper Case
3. I,Bless.The.Rains? - 18 Characters, 4 Symbols, Mix of Lower & Upper Case
4. I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns? - 18 Characters, 4 Symbols , Mix of Lower &Upper Case, 4 Symbols ,4 Numbers

Obviously 4 is the most secure but it is more difficult to remember initially - Don't panic below we have solutions on keeping passwords.

---

There are many different ways your account/password can be taken however we’ll cover the main ones:

1. BruteForce: This is when a person or program will go through millions of combinations of passwords to break in.

2. Online Hack: If you have gotten malware your computer is compromised and information on your computer can be sent to the hacker.

3. Data Breach \(See Yahoo Hacks / Cloudbleed\): Sadly companies aren’t perfect and their services either have bugs or get hacked releasing personal information, sometimes including passwords.

---

However people fail to realise that using the same password for different websites/accounts is a very insecure choice. Take thsi example below:

You have an account on Stroodlemail.com, the service or you accidentally expose your account details \(these things do happen - see the recent yahoo hacks - link here\). Your email address and password are now out for anyone to see, people will now try using this information on different services - if you use the same password elsewhere - they are now in your other accounts.

You have multiple options with different passwords:

1. Having one major secure password and adding an unique code at the end of each different service. for example:Major Password: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns? Password when using Stroodlemail: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**STR** \(Adding STR for **STROODLEMAIL**\)Password when using Seddit: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**SED** \(Adding SED for **SED**DIT\)**Pros:** This means you only need to remember one password and the formula for additional services. **Cons:** A directed attack on you means an individual could figure out your system.
2. Using a password manager. This is a piece of software or addon for browsers which save the passwords you use. Think of it as a Vault or Safe, You're storing all your passwords in there for the computer to remember. **Pros:** Allows you to use very very complicated long passwords, which means more security. You also never need to remember passwords again \(except the master password to enter\)**Cons:** There is a small learning curve to understand the software.
3. The Old Fashioned way. Have unique different passwords for each service and write them down and keep them safe.

**Pros:** Allows for secure passwords. No memorisation needed

**Cons:** Someone physically near you could steal your passwords.

Now all 3 systems have their pros and cons, choose which suits you best but make sure you are using different passwords for different services!

### **If you have chosen to use a password manager. We recommend trying:**

**Keepass -** This is a Open Source local only Password manager meaning syncing between multiple devices is less straight forward. Recommended if you do not require your passwords on more than one device.

How to setup:

**LastPass**

This is a comercial product with a free version with easy sync between multiple devices \(phones, tablets, computers\). Recommended for ease of use for multiple devices

How to setup:

**BitWarden**

A Open Source product with a free version with easy sync between multiple devices \(phones, tablets, computers\). Recommended if you prefer open source alternatives.

# **Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\)**

2Factor Authentication is just as if not MORE important as having a secure password. As the name suggests it means when logging onto a service you have to provide a second method of authentication. This can be simply a text message with a code, an APP or a piece of hardware. The most secure method is a hardware dongle however an APP is the best middle ground, avoid text based authentication unless there are no other options.

# **IoT/Smart Devices**

Include Information

# **Wifi & Routers**

* Public Wifi - When on a public Wifi \(Cafes/Stations/Airports etc\) you are susceptible to having your activity on the internet maliciously tracked. It is highly recommended not to log into important accounts when on one of these Wifis. Use your phones 3G/4G for important browsing when away from work or home.

* Device Settings - Passwords on Routers/Smart Devices/IoT devices **must be changed from the default** when obtained - feel free to write the new password down but do not use the default one**. Do not take this lightly.** Remote access to your devices can easily done if using the default password.

* Routers - A router is the box connecting you to the internet. There are two main settings you need to confirm are in the right state:

1. In your router settings \(generally found at the URL 192.168.2.1\) Turn off Universal Plug and Play \(uPNP\) - this mode has many security issues and can allow external hackers access , You will know if you need it but 99% of people DO NOT.

2. If you are using Wireless\(Wifi\) to connect to the internet rather than a cable make sure you have a secure password to connect to as well as a** none default ADMIN password**. To do this visit your Routers internal website \(usually found at 192.168.2.1\) log in with the information given generally found on the back of your router. If the settings are not visible look for a "advanced" section. _ Make sure you are using WPA2 as your Security Protocol \(all devices bought after 2006 should have it set by default\)_



# **Physical Defense:**

**Encrypting:**

**Veracrypt \(Most major operating systems\) https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/**

**BitLocker \(Windows 10\)**

**FileVault \(Mac\)**





# **Abbreviations and Terms**

Cookies - A small file created when visiting a website which stores data specific to that user \(login session, personal information\)

Cloud - Using or storing data on the internet

Wifi- Wireless Network \(connecting to the internet without a cable\)

Lan - Local Area Network

Wan - Wide Area Network

URL - Uniform Resource Locator - the address used for a website - ie "stroodle.com"

IP Address - Internet Protocol Address - generally each device is assigned with an address \(think of it like a street address\) made up of numbers for example 192.168.2.1 

Router - a router is a device which transmits digital internet traffic to and from your computer/phone/tablet. Generally connectable via Wifi or Ethernet cable

Modem - a modem is a device usually connected to your phoneline to translate to digital from the phone line \(needs wording\). These are either built into your router or their own box.

# **Privacy**

"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "

Internet Privacy is overlooked by most users but its a right being degraded and fought for. Billion Dollar industries take advantage of the lack of knowledge/interest of the general public. This guide isn't about Privacy but security but I highly recommend you looking into it. Check out PrivacyTools.Io
