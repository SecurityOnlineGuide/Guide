Virtual Private Network

You may connect to a VPN for your Business/Company without knowing it. VPN's are used to encrypt all network data, making it very difficult for someone to monitor your traffic from the WiFi level or even ISP. This is a great tool when using Open Wifi networks as it allows you to complete sensitive tasks like doing your bank or buying something without worrying about your traffic being snooped. It also assigns you for the outside world a different IP address which means a targeted attack on you is much more difficult.

Free VPN's are generally a very bad idea.
