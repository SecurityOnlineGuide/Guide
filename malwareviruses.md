# **Malware/Viruses**

Whether you're new to computers or the internet or have been around a while, almost everyone has heard of Viruses or Malware.

Malware is an umbrella term for the joint two words "Malicious"+"Software".

The objective of the software could be as simple as showing you an advertisement to the more extreme like tracking your activity, stealing your bank details or recording you.

### **How to avoid**

The most common ways viruses/malware are obtained are

1. Downloading\(see [\#Downloading](/downloading.md)\)

2. e-Mail attachments\(see [\#email](/e-mail.md)\)

3. Software/Operating System not up to Date\(see [\#Operating System](/operating-systems.md)\)

4. Malicious Websites â€“ \(see [\#domain](/domains.md) and [\#Downloading](/downloading.md)\)
