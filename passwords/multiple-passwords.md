# Multiple Passwords



However people fail to realise that using the same password for different websites/accounts is a very insecure choice. Take thsi example below:

You have an account on Stroodlemail.com, the service or you accidentally expose your account details \(these things do happen - see the recent yahoo hacks - link here\). Your email address and password are now out for anyone to see, people will now try using this information on different services - if you use the same password elsewhere - they are now in your other accounts.

You have multiple options with different passwords:

1. Having one major secure password and adding an unique code at the end of each different service. for example:Major Password: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns? Password when using Stroodlemail: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**STR** \(Adding STR for **STROODLEMAIL**\)Password when using Seddit: I,Ble55.Th3-Ra1ns?**SED** \(Adding SED for **SED**DIT\)**Pros:** This means you only need to remember one password and the formula for additional services. **Cons:** A directed attack on you means an individual could figure out your system.
2. Using a password manager. This is a piece of software or addon for browsers which save the passwords you use. Think of it as a Vault or Safe, You're storing all your passwords in there for the computer to remember. **Pros:** Allows you to use very very complicated long passwords, which means more security. You also never need to remember passwords again \(except the master password to enter\)**Cons:** There is a small learning curve to understand the software.
3. The Old Fashioned way. Have unique different passwords for each service and write them down and keep them safe.

**Pros:** Allows for secure passwords. No memorisation needed

**Cons:** Someone physically near you could steal your passwords.

Now all 3 systems have their pros and cons, choose which suits you best but make sure you are using different passwords for different services!
